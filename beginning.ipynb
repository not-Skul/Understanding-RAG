Initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the bloc expanded following the 2023 BRICS summit, which formally invited Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates to join. In 2025, Indonesia became a full member, further enhancing the group’s global influence.\\nToday, BRICS nations collectively represent approximately 3.3 billion people, accounting for over 40% of the world’s population. Their economies contribute an estimated 37.3% of global GDP, reflecting their significant economic weight. The grouping, boasting massive consumer markets and workforce populations, has emerged as a key engine of global economic expansion, underscoring its significant role in reshaping the international economic order.\\nStartups are at the forefront of driving economic growth, technological innovation, and societal impact globally, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future. Recognizing this, fostering cross-border exchange of knowledge, expertise, and resources is essential for the holistic development of startups and their ecosystems across BRICS nations. Collaboration among them is essential to achieve the SDGs to reduce poverty, promote entrepreneurship, provide employment opportunities, and generate sustainable livelihoods across the world. With this vision, the BRICS Startup Forum was announced in 2021, during India’s Presidency. The BRICS Startup Forum aims to promote cross-border collaboration through various entrepreneurial activities amongst the BRICS nations.\\nThe BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub was launched on 31st January 2025 as part of the BRICS Startup Forum. The Agenda for the program may be found here. The BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub (microsite) is the first-ever BRICS Startup Knowledge Repository which lays the foundation for multilateral cooperation and engagement among the BRICS countries to develop and hone their startup ecosystems. The Knowledge Repository aims to enable startups, investors, incubators, and aspiring entrepreneurs of BRICS countries to collaborate and exchange knowledge.\\nThe Knowledge Hub will serve as a one-stop gateway to the BRICS startup ecosystem, offering valuable insights into the unique entrepreneurial landscapes of each member country. As a dynamic engagement platform and comprehensive digital resource, it will bridge the gap between startups, investors, and stakeholders, unlocking opportunities for collaboration and growth within the BRICS nations.\\nKnow more:\\nTo foster collaboration and deeper engagement between the startup ecosystems of all BRICS countries.\\nTo connect with and amplify the BRICS countries’ Startup ecosystems.\\nPromoting cross border collaborations through various entrepreneurial activities amongst the BRICS nations.\\nTo give a stage to Startups from India and BRICS countries and helping them to generate business, funding and mentorship opportunities.\\nPopulation: 212.6 million\\nGDP (in USD): $3.967 trillion (2023)\\nHuman Development Index: 0.802, ranking 67th globally\\nGlobal Innovation Index: 50\\nNumber of Startups: 16,000+ (2024)\\nNumber of unicorns: 24\\nLeading startup sectors: Fintech, Edtech, Agritech and New Food\\nInvestor pool and funding: $119B\\nActive innovation agencies and incubators: Startup Brasil, Google For Startups Accelerator Brazil, Gupy, Loft\\nBrazil is the largest startup ecosystem in Latin America and one of the largest in the world.

The idea is—can you play physically through movements in the digital world? And when you play this game, can we look into your brain health and your entire biomechanic, which could help you live longer and happier? Our idea was—can we use this stimulation potential to help people improve their overall condition? Be it neurodevelopmental conditions in kids like autism, ADHD, learning disability, cerebral palsy, so on and so forth; or be it neurodegenerative diseases in elders—be it Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s, dementia; or in normal adults—be it metabolic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, PCOD, so on and so forth. So the idea was—can we use game for healthcare? And that could help people go.\\nAnd that led us to build a complete console which could actually do the same thing and thereby help you not only improve your potential with regards to your profession but also give you a very happy and long life.\\nWe are really excited to be part of Chartup Bahum and thanks to WZO for giving us this opportunity and the challenge that they\\'ve brought in in BHARAT Startup Grand Challenge for Gaming for Good focusing on healthcare. It was really a good initiative for us, and I think it\\'s tailor-made for what we have done because we brought in AI together, healthcare together, and gaming—all the three booming segments together—and that actually has culminated to this victory for us.

The importance of these factors would vary depending on the stage of investment, sector of startup, management team, etc. Listed below are typical investment criteria used by investors:\\n1. Market Landscape: Refers to the addressable market that the startup is catering to.\\nFactors: Market size, obtainable market share, adoption rate, historical and forecasted growth rates, macroeconomic drivers, demand-supply.\\n2. Scalability and Sustainability : Startups should showcase the potential upscale in the near future, a sustainable and stable business plan.\\nFactors: Barriers to entry, imitation costs, growth rate, expansion plans.\\n3. Objective and Problem-Solving : The offering of the startup should be differentiated to solve a unique customer problem or to meet customer needs. Ideas or products that are patented showcase deemed potential in the startups.\\n4. Customers and Suppliers: Laying out your customers and suppliers, helps investors understand your business better.\\nFactors: Customer relationships, stickiness to the product, vendor terms, existing vendors.\\n5. Competitive Analysis: A true picture of competition and other players in the market working on similar things should be highlighted. There can never be an apple-to-apple comparison, but highlighting the service or product offerings of similar players in the industry is important.\\nFactors: Number of players in the market, market share, obtainable share in the near future, product mapping to highlight similarities or differences between competitor offerings.\\n6. Sales and Marketing: No matter how good your product or service may be, if it does not find any end use, there is no good.\\nFactors: Sales forecast, targeted audiences, marketing plan for the target, conversion and retention ratio, etc.\\n7. Financial Assessment: A detailed business model that showcases the cash inflows over the years, investments required, key milestones, break-even points, and growth rates should be made out well. Assumptions used at this stage should also be reasonable and clearly mentioned.\\nSee sample valuation template here.(to be sourced under templates section)\\n8. Exit Avenues: A startup showcasing potential future acquirers or alliance partners becomes a valuable decision parameter for the investor.\\n9. Management and Team: The execution and passion of the founder and the management team to drive the company is equally crucial in addition to all the factors mentioned above.\\nInvestors realise their return on investment from startups through various means of exit. Ideally, the VC firm and the entrepreneur should discuss the various exit options at the beginning of investment negotiations. A well-performing, high-growth startup that also has excellent management and organisational processes is more likely to be exit-ready earlier than other startups.\\nVenture capital and private equity funds must exit all their investments before the end of the fund’s life. The common exit methods are:\\n1. Mergers and Acquisitions: The investor may decide to sell the portfolio company to another company in the market. For example, the $140 million acquisition of RedBus by South African Internet and media giant Naspers and its integration with its India arm, Ibibo Group, presented an exit option for its investors, Seedfund, Inventus Capital Partners, and Helion Venture Partners.\\n2. IPO: An initial public offering is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. Issued by private companies seeking capital to expand, it is one of the preferred options for investors looking to exit a startup organisation.\\n3. Exit to Financial Investors: Investors may sell their investment to other venture capital or private equity firms.\\n4. Distressed Sale: Under financially stressed times for a startup company, the investors may decide to sell the business to another company or a financial institution.\\n5. Buybacks: Founders of the startup may also buy back their investment from the fund.\\nA term sheet is a “Non-binding” list of propositions by a venture capital firm at the beginning stages of a deal. It summarises the major points of engagement in the deal between the investment firm and the startup.\\nA term sheet for a venture capital transaction in India typically includes four structural provisions: valuation, investment and management structures, and changes to share capital.\\n1. Value: Startup valuations are the total worth of the company as estimated by a professional valuer. There are various means of valuing a startup company, like the Cost to Duplicate approach, the Market Multiple approach, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and the valuation-by-stage approach. Investors choose the relevant approach based on the stage of the investment and the market maturity of the startup.\\n2. Investment Structure: It defines the mode of venture capital investment in the startup, whether it is through equity, debt, or a combination of both.\\n3. Management Structure: The term sheet details the management structure of the company, including the composition of the board of directors and prescribed appointment and removal procedures.\\n4. Changes to share capital: All investors in startups have their own investment timelines, and they accordingly seek flexibility in seeking exit options through subsequent rounds of funding. The term sheet addresses the stakeholders’ rights and obligations with respect to subsequent changes in the company’s share capital.\\nYour password must contain atleast:\\n* Your password must contain atleast:\\nPlease Complete Your Profile to Access This.\\nStartup India Portal is a one of its kind online platform for all stakeholders of the startup ecosystem in India.\\nForgot your Password\\nPlease Enter Your OTP Password sent on your Email Id\\nPlease change your password\\nYour Password has been changed successfully.\\nLogin here\\n\\nURL: https://www.startupindia.gov.in//content/sih/en/international/go-to-market-guide.html\\n▲\\nYour password must contain atleast:\\n* Your password must contain atleast:\\nPlease Complete Your Profile to Access This.\\nStartup India Portal is a one of its kind online platform for all stakeholders of the startup ecosystem in India.\\nForgot your Password\\nPlease Enter Your OTP Password sent on your Email Id\\nPlease change your password\\nYour Password has been changed successfully.\\nLogin here\\n\\n'"

To be eligible, the startup needs to be DPIIT recognized.\\n*   **Patent and Trademark Facilitation:** The context highlights that filing patents can be expensive and time-consuming. There are facilitators available to help startups with patent and trademark applications, aiming to reduce cost and time. This is particularly relevant for tech startups that often rely on intellectual property.\\n*   **State-Specific Policies:** Several states offer various benefits. For example, Maharashtra offers an \"Incentive Fund for Top-rated Startup,\" \"Investment Fund,\" and reimbursements for internet, electricity, and GST. Puducherry offers a \"monthly allowance to startups by women entrepreneurs.\" These could be beneficial depending on the specific tech startup and its location.\\n*   **Capital Grants for Infrastructure:** Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand offer capital grants for IT infrastructure setup for host institutes and incubators, which could indirectly benefit tech startups housed within them.\\n\\nTo determine the *most* beneficial schemes, you would need to consider the specific needs and stage of a particular tech startup.'"

      "\n",
      "1.  \"Government schemes for technology startups India\"\n",
      "2.  \"Startup India schemes for tech companies\"\n",
      "3.  \"Funding and support programs for Indian tech startups\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Question: 1.  \"Government grants and funding for early-stage tech startups\"\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, here's information relevant to government grants and funding for early-stage tech startups:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Startup India Website:** The `startupindia.gov.in` website is a key resource. It mentions the \"Pre-Seed Stage\" of a startup, where entrepreneurs have an idea and are working to bring it to life. At this stage, funding needs are usually small, and channels are often informal.\n",
      "*   **Bootstrapping and Friends/Family:** For the pre-seed stage, bootstrapping (using personal savings and revenue) and seeking investment from friends and family are common initial funding methods. These offer benefits like no pressure to repay or dilute control.\n",
      "*   **State-Level Policies:** Several states in India offer specific support for startups, which could include grants and funding:\n",
      "    *   **Maharashtra:** Offers an \"Incentive Fund for Top-rated Startup,\" creation of an \"Investment Fund,\" reimbursement for various expenses (internet, electricity, hosting infrastructure, State GST, event participation), and a \"FinTech Corpus Fund\" for early-stage fintech startups with women founders.\n",
      "    *   **Manipur:** Provides \"neighbourhood hand holding and mentoring support\" for rural startups and those by women entrepreneurs through Facilitation Centres.\n",
      "    *   **Nagaland:** Dedicates 25% of total funds for startups to women-led startups.\n",
      "    *   **Puducherry:** Offers a monthly allowance to startups by women entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the context doesn't explicitly list \"government grants\" by name, the state-specific policies and the mention of \"funding and support programs\" on the Startup India website suggest that government initiatives are in place to support early-stage tech startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: 2.  \"Venture capital and angel investor programs for technology companies\"\n",
      "Answer: Venture capital (VC) and angel investor programs are crucial for technology companies, particularly in their growth and scaling phases. While the provided context doesn't detail specific \"programs\" in the sense of structured government initiatives for VCs and angel investors, it highlights their significant role and how they benefit startups:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Raising Subsequent Funding Rounds:** Investors, including VCs, are described as the \"best guides\" for startups to secure future funding. They assess a startup's stage, maturity, and sector focus to help them raise subsequent rounds.\n",
      "*   **Networking and Connections:** VCs and angel investors can significantly aid founders by facilitating networking and making connections, enabling them to pitch their businesses to a wider pool of potential investors.\n",
      "*   **Recruiting Talent:** With their extensive networks, VCs can help startups bridge the talent gap by assisting in recruiting high-quality senior executives and other essential human capital needed to drive business goals.\n",
      "*   **Marketing Strategy:** VCs can provide valuable assistance in developing and refining the marketing strategy for a startup's product or service.\n",
      "*   **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** VCs actively monitor the entrepreneurial ecosystem for M&A opportunities, which can lead to inorganic growth and greater value addition for the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context also indirectly points to resources where information about tech startup funding, which would include VC and angel investment, can be found. For instance, reports like the \"Indian Tech Startup Funding Report\" by INC42 are listed, suggesting that data and analysis on this type of investment are available.\n",
      "\n",

       "\"Here's a scientific paper passage addressing the question of beneficial schemes for tech startups, focusing on a structured and evidence-based approach:\\n\\n## 3. Analysis of Beneficial Schemes for Technology Startups\\n\\nThe successful launch and sustained growth of technology startups are critically dependent on access to appropriate financial and strategic support mechanisms. This section critically analyzes various schemes, evaluating their potential benefits and limitations for early-stage technology ventures. The efficacy of a scheme is assessed based on its ability to address key startup challenges, including capital acquisition, market validation, talent recruitment, and intellectual property protection.\\n\\n**3.1. Seed and Venture Capital Funding:**\\n\\nSeed and venture capital (VC) funding represent a cornerstone of startup development, particularly for technology-intensive businesses requiring significant upfront investment in research, development, and scaling. **Benefits** are manifold: VCs provide not only crucial capital but also strategic guidance, industry connections, and operational expertise, acting as active partners in growth. This financial injection enables rapid product development, market penetration, and the hiring of specialized talent. Furthermore, the rigorous due diligence process associated with VC funding can serve as a valuable market validation mechanism, signaling investor confidence to potential customers and partners. However, **limitations** exist. The pursuit of VC funding can be time-consuming and competitive, with a high failure rate for pitches. Moreover, the inherent pressure for rapid growth and significant returns can sometimes lead to misaligned priorities between founders and investors, potentially compromising long-term vision for short-term gains.\\n\\n**3.2. Government Grants and Subsidies:**\\n\\nGovernment-backed initiatives, such as research and development grants, innovation vouchers, and tax credits, offer a distinct set of advantages for tech startups. The primary **benefit** lies in their non-dilutive nature, meaning founders retain full equity ownership. These grants are often targeted towards specific technological areas or societal challenges, providing crucial early-stage funding for high-risk, high-reward research that might be unattractive to private investors. They can also legitimize nascent technologies and foster collaborations with academic institutions. The **limitations** often revolve around the application process, which can be bureaucratic and lengthy, requiring detailed proposals and adherence to strict reporting requirements. Furthermore, the funding amounts may be insufficient for large-scale commercialization, and the focus is typically on innovation rather than immediate market traction.\\n\\n**3.3. Incubators and Accelerators:**\\n\\nIncubator and accelerator programs offer a structured environment for startups to develop their business models, refine their products, and gain market access. The **benefits** are substantial, encompassing mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and industry experts, access to co-working spaces and shared resources, and networking opportunities with potential investors, customers, and strategic partners. Accelerators, in particular, often provide a fixed-term, cohort-based program with a demo day for pitching to investors, accelerating growth and market validation. The **limitations** include the competitive selection process and the equity stake often required by accelerators in exchange for their services. The intensity of accelerator programs can also be demanding, requiring significant commitment from the founding team.\\n\\n**3.4. Angel Investment Networks:**\\n\\nAngel investors, typically high-net-worth individuals, provide early-stage capital and often possess valuable industry experience and networks. The **benefits** of angel investment include faster decision-making processes compared to institutional VCs and a greater willingness to invest in unproven concepts. Angels can offer personalized mentorship and open doors to their professional circles. However, the **limitations** can include the potential for less formal governance compared to VC funding, and the investment amounts may be smaller, requiring multiple angel rounds. The quality and engagement of angel investors can also vary significantly.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe most beneficial schemes for tech startups are not mutually exclusive and often work in synergy. **Seed and venture capital funding** are paramount for scaling and market dominance, provided the startup can demonstrate strong growth potential. **Government grants** are invaluable for de-risking early-stage R&D and fostering innovation without diluting equity. **Incubators and accelerators** provide essential structure, mentorship, and network access for early validation and growth. **Angel investors** offer a crucial bridge for initial funding and experienced guidance. Therefore, a strategic approach that leverages a combination of these schemes, tailored to the specific stage of development and the unique needs of the technology, is most likely to yield optimal outcomes for tech startups.\""
