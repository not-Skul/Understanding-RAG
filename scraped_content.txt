BRICS is a pivotal grouping that has emerged as a powerful force in shaping the global economic landscape, dedicated to fostering cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, technology, and global governance. Initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the bloc expanded following the 2023 BRICS summit, which formally invited Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates to join. In 2025, Indonesia became a full member, further enhancing the group’s global influence.
Today, BRICS nations collectively represent approximately 3.3 billion people, accounting for over 40% of the world’s population. Their economies contribute an estimated 37.3% of global GDP, reflecting their significant economic weight. The grouping, boasting massive consumer markets and workforce populations, has emerged as a key engine of global economic expansion, underscoring its significant role in reshaping the international economic order.
Startups are at the forefront of driving economic growth, technological innovation, and societal impact globally, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future. Recognizing this, fostering cross-border exchange of knowledge, expertise, and resources is essential for the holistic development of startups and their ecosystems across BRICS nations. Collaboration among them is essential to achieve the SDGs to reduce poverty, promote entrepreneurship, provide employment opportunities, and generate sustainable livelihoods across the world. With this vision, the BRICS Startup Forum was announced in 2021, during India’s Presidency. The BRICS Startup Forum aims to promote cross-border collaboration through various entrepreneurial activities amongst the BRICS nations.
The BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub was launched on 31st January 2025 as part of the BRICS Startup Forum. The Agenda for the program may be found here. The BRICS Startup Knowledge Hub (microsite) is the first-ever BRICS Startup Knowledge Repository which lays the foundation for multilateral cooperation and engagement among the BRICS countries to develop and hone their startup ecosystems. The Knowledge Repository aims to enable startups, investors, incubators, and aspiring entrepreneurs of BRICS countries to collaborate and exchange knowledge.
The Knowledge Hub will serve as a one-stop gateway to the BRICS startup ecosystem, offering valuable insights into the unique entrepreneurial landscapes of each member country. As a dynamic engagement platform and comprehensive digital resource, it will bridge the gap between startups, investors, and stakeholders, unlocking opportunities for collaboration and growth within the BRICS nations.

In 2024, the South African startup ecosystem was ranked 52nd globally.
South Africa is home to over 600+ startups spanning from energy to the fintech industry.
In 2024, the venture capital investments surpassed $164 million for the first time with a shift to larger deals with fewer companies.
In December 2024, South Africa had its first unicorn.
South Africa’s startup ecosystem is more than Fintech, with more diversity from key areas such as climate tech, mainly driven by solar energy and mobility startups, ICT, healthcare, edtech, agriculture, advanced manufacturing, and mining.
Deeptech is emerging as the next frontier in South Africa’s startup ecosystem, but barriers remain to growth and scale.
The investment ecosystem is performing despite a hard regulation environment. (While existing regulations around IP, exchange controls, and visas present barriers for the ecosystem, the government has enabled the ecosystem in other ways.)
The private sector plays a big role in driving startup investments in South Africa.

Partner with usAt Zuron, we are building the world's first neurocomputing-based digital gaming console. The idea is—can you play physically through movements in the digital world? And when you play this game, can we look into your brain health and your entire biomechanic, which could help you live longer and happier? Our idea was—can we use this stimulation potential to help people improve their overall condition? Be it neurodevelopmental conditions in kids like autism, ADHD, learning disability, cerebral palsy, so on and so forth; or be it neurodegenerative diseases in elders—be it Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia; or in normal adults—be it metabolic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, PCOD, so on and so forth. So the idea was—can we use game for healthcare? And that could help people go.
And that led us to build a complete console which could actually do the same thing and thereby help you not only improve your potential with regards to your profession but also give you a very happy and long life.
We are really excited to be part of Chartup Bahum and thanks to WZO for giving us this opportunity and the challenge that they've brought in in BHARAT Startup Grand Challenge for Gaming for Good focusing on healthcare. It was really a good initiative for us, and I think it's tailor-made for what we have done because we brought in AI together, healthcare together, and gaming—all the three booming segments together—and that actually has culminated to this victory for us. We are really happy to be part of this entire mega event that's been happening in Delhi.

Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are emerging as a strategic business tool for any business organisation to enhance industrial competitiveness. Startups, with limited resources and manpower, can sustain themselves in this highly competitive world only through continuous growth and development-orientated innovations; for this, it is equally crucial that they protect their IPRs in India and outside. The scheme for Startups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) is envisaged to facilitate the protection of Patents, Trademarks and Designs of innovative and interested Startups in India and outside.

The GFRs 2017 have defined 5 kinds of tenders as below:
i. Advertised Tender Enquiry
Invitation to tenders by advertisement should be used for procurement of goods of estimated value of Rs. 25 lakhs and above. In such cases, the tender enquiry should be advertised on the Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) at www.eprocure.gov.in and on GeM. An organisation having its own website should also publish all its advertised tender enquiries on the website.
ii. Limited Tender Enquiry
In a limited tender enquiry, various vendors (more than three) are empaneled by the Government Department for goods that are procured regularly by the Department. Usually Limited Tender Enquiry is adopted when the estimated value of the goods to be procured is less than INR 25 Lac.
iii. Two-Stage Bidding
For purchasing high-value plant, machinery, etc. of a complex and technical nature, bids may consist of two parts, as below:
a. Technical bid consisting of all technical details along with commercial terms and conditions; and
b. Financial bid indicating item-wise price for the items mentioned in the technical bid.
iv. Single Tender Enquiry
Procurement from a single source may be resorted to in the following circumstances:
a. When only a particular firm is a manufacturer of the required goods, to the best of the concerned government department's knowledge.
b. In case of an emergency, when it is necessary to purchase the required goods from a particular source. In such cases, the reason for such a decision must be recorded, and approval of competent authority must be obtained.
c. When specific standardised machines or spare parts have to be acquired in order to be compatible with existing sets of equipment (on the advice of a competent technical expert and approved by the relevant authority).
v. Electronic Reverse Auctions
An Electronic Reverse Auction is a type of online auction in which the traditional roles of buyer and seller in an auction are reversed. In an ordinary auction, buyers compete to obtain goods or services by offering increasingly higher prices. Conversely, in an electronic reverse auction, there is one buyer and many potential sellers. The sellers compete to obtain business from the buyer, and prices will typically decrease as the sellers underbid each other.

Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a permanent intergovernmental international organisation, comprising 9 Member States, namely the Republic of India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the People’s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan, and the Republic of Uzbekistan. The SCO focusses on strengthening mutual trust and neighbourliness among the Member States, promoting their effective cooperation in politics, trade, economy, research, technology, and culture, as well as in education, energy, transport, tourism, environmental protection, and other areas; making joint efforts to maintain and ensure peace, security, and stability in the region; and moving towards the establishment of a democratic, fair, and rational new international political and economic order.
India has taken several initiatives to build to empower the local startup ecosystems in the SCO Member States, provide value to startups through mentoring and enabling access to investor and corporate engagement activities ,and solve social problems through innovative solutions and exchange knowledge on how institutional interventions can be introduced to support the startup ecosystem. A detailed report can be accessed here:
All Member States agreed to create a Special Working Group for Startups and Innovation (SWG) at the Summit of SCO Heads of State in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on 16th September 2022. Given the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in driving and diversifying an economy, India proposed this initiative in 2020 to create a new pillar of cooperation between the SCO Member States. The SWG was created with the vision of fostering collaboration among SCO Member States, to not only benefit the startup ecosystem but also accelerate regional economic development. After multiple rounds of meetings chaired by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India, the Member States decided to approve and adopt the Regulations of the SWG to be permanently chaired by India in SCO.
DPIIT has organised various initiatives for the startup ecosystems of the SCO Member States since 2020, including three editions of the SCO Startup Forum. By leading such engagements, India undertook an opportunity to expand the innovation footprint, knitting the whole ecosystem together and inspiring other SCO Member States to take up similar programs.

This is the stage where the entrepreneur has an idea and is working on bringing it to life. At this stage, the amount of funds needed is usually small. Additionally, at the initial stage in the startup lifecycle, there are very limited and mostly informal channels available for raising funds.
Pre-Seed Stage
Bootstrapping/Self-financing:
Bootstrapping a startup means growing the business with little or no venture capital or outside investment. It means relying on your savings and revenue to operate and expand. This is the first recourse for most entrepreneurs, as there is no pressure to pay back the funds or dilute control of your startup.
Friends and Family
This is also a commonly utilised channel of funding by entrepreneurs still in the early stages. The major benefit of this source of investment is that there is an inherent level of trust between the entrepreneurs and the investors.
Business Plan/Pitching Events
This is the prize money/grants/financial benefits that are provided by institutes or organisations that conduct business plan competitions and challenges. Even though the quantum of money is not generally large, it is usually enough at the idea stage. What makes the difference at these events is having a good business plan.

Investors, particularly venture capitalists (VCs), add value to startups in a lot of ways:
1. Stakeholder Management: Investors manage the company board and leadership to facilitate smooth operations of the startup. In addition, their functional experience and domain knowledge of working and investing with startups impart vision and direction to the company.
2. Raising Funds: Investors are the best guides for the startup to raise subsequent rounds of funding on the basis of stage, maturity, sector focus, etc. and aid in networking and connection for the founders to pitch their business to other investors.
3. Recruiting Talent: Sourcing high-quality and best-fit human capital is critical for startups, especially when it comes to recruiting senior executives to manage and drive business goals. VCs, with their extensive network, can help bridge the talent gap by recruiting the right set of people at the right time.
4. Marketing: VCs assist with marketing strategy for your product/service.
5. M and A Activity: VCs have their eyes and ears open to merger and acquisition opportunities in the local entrepreneurial ecosystem to enable greater value addition to the business through inorganic growth.
6. Organisational Restructuring: As a young startup matures into an established company, VCs help with the right organisational structuring and introduce processes to increase capital efficiency, lower costs, and scale efficiently.
Investing in startups is a risky proposition, but the low requirement for overhead capital combined with high upside potential makes it lucrative for investors to put their bets on startups.
The Thomson Reuters Venture Capital Research Index replicated the performance of the venture capital industry in 2012 and found that overall venture capital has returned at an annual rate of 20% since 1996—far outperforming modest returns of 7.5% and 5.9% from public equities and bonds, respectively.
Registering a profile on the hub is a fairly simple process.
The system is built to connect you to your relevant stakeholders based on your industry and preferred stage. Under the profile of every enabler, there will be an option to "connect/apply." Upon clicking, a request will be sent to the respective profile for acceptance. Once accepted, you will be able to see the enabler as a new connection.
Please note that you can connect with up to 3 users per week.

As a mentor, you have access to all registered startups across all stages on the Hub. The startups may connect with you through a connection request, post which you can provide your expert advice to the startup on its next steps. To know more, kindly go to the Mentor’s Section.
A startup is allowed to send 3 connection requests each week. This is done by simply clicking on the “connect” button on the mentor’s profile. Once you accept a connection request, the startup can reach out to you through a simple chat interface. You can learn more about the Startup that has connected with you by clicking on their profile and reading up about them.
While we encourage more engagement on the platform, we can understand that access to high-quality mentor investors like yourself can be overwhelming for some Startups, which may lead to spam. To ensure Startups are conservative and careful with the mentor/investor requests, we restrict each Startup to 3 connection requests each week.

Different investors use different criteria to judge an investment. The importance of these factors would vary depending on the stage of investment, sector of startup, management team, etc. Listed below are typical investment criteria used by investors:
1. Market Landscape: Refers to the addressable market that the startup is catering to.
Factors: Market size, obtainable market share, adoption rate, historical and forecasted growth rates, macroeconomic drivers, demand-supply.
2. Scalability and Sustainability : Startups should showcase the potential upscale in the near future, a sustainable and stable business plan.
Factors: Barriers to entry, imitation costs, growth rate, expansion plans.
3. Objective and Problem-Solving : The offering of the startup should be differentiated to solve a unique customer problem or to meet customer needs. Ideas or products that are patented showcase deemed potential in the startups.
4. Customers and Suppliers: Laying out your customers and suppliers, helps investors understand your business better.
Factors: Customer relationships, stickiness to the product, vendor terms, existing vendors.
5. Competitive Analysis: A true picture of competition and other players in the market working on similar things should be highlighted. There can never be an apple-to-apple comparison, but highlighting the service or product offerings of similar players in the industry is important.
Factors: Number of players in the market, market share, obtainable share in the near future, product mapping to highlight similarities or differences between competitor offerings.
6. Sales and Marketing: No matter how good your product or service may be, if it does not find any end use, there is no good.
Factors: Sales forecast, targeted audiences, marketing plan for the target, conversion and retention ratio, etc.
7. Financial Assessment: A detailed business model that showcases the cash inflows over the years, investments required, key milestones, break-even points, and growth rates should be made out well. Assumptions used at this stage should also be reasonable and clearly mentioned.
See sample valuation template here.(to be sourced under templates section)
8. Exit Avenues: A startup showcasing potential future acquirers or alliance partners becomes a valuable decision parameter for the investor.
9. Management and Team: The execution and passion of the founder and the management team to drive the company is equally crucial in addition to all the factors mentioned above.
Investors realise their return on investment from startups through various means of exit. Ideally, the VC firm and the entrepreneur should discuss the various exit options at the beginning of investment negotiations. A well-performing, high-growth startup that also has excellent management and organisational processes is more likely to be exit-ready earlier than other startups.
Venture capital and private equity funds must exit all their investments before the end of the fund’s life. The common exit methods are:
1. Mergers and Acquisitions: The investor may decide to sell the portfolio company to another company in the market. For example, the $140 million acquisition of RedBus by South African Internet and media giant Naspers and its integration with its India arm, Ibibo Group, presented an exit option for its investors, Seedfund, Inventus Capital Partners, and Helion Venture Partners.
2. IPO: An initial public offering is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. Issued by private companies seeking capital to expand, it is one of the preferred options for investors looking to exit a startup organisation.
3. Exit to Financial Investors: Investors may sell their investment to other venture capital or private equity firms.
4. Distressed Sale: Under financially stressed times for a startup company, the investors may decide to sell the business to another company or a financial institution.
5. Buybacks: Founders of the startup may also buy back their investment from the fund.
A term sheet is a “Non-binding” list of propositions by a venture capital firm at the beginning stages of a deal. It summarises the major points of engagement in the deal between the investment firm and the startup.
A term sheet for a venture capital transaction in India typically includes four structural provisions: valuation, investment and management structures, and changes to share capital.
1. Value: Startup valuations are the total worth of the company as estimated by a professional valuer. There are various means of valuing a startup company, like the Cost to Duplicate approach, the Market Multiple approach, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and the valuation-by-stage approach. Investors choose the relevant approach based on the stage of the investment and the market maturity of the startup.
2. Investment Structure: It defines the mode of venture capital investment in the startup, whether it is through equity, debt, or a combination of both.
3. Management Structure: The term sheet details the management structure of the company, including the composition of the board of directors and prescribed appointment and removal procedures.
4. Changes to share capital: All investors in startups have their own investment timelines, and they accordingly seek flexibility in seeking exit options through subsequent rounds of funding. The term sheet addresses the stakeholders’ rights and obligations with respect to subsequent changes in the company’s share capital.
